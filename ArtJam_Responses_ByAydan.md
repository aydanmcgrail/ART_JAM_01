Great job! You seem to understand the knowledge of sliders very well! Looking at your script.js, everything and concise and clear. Even though I don't know how sliders works, looking at your script could be a great way to learn it. Special mention to your //text description above all important parts this helps me understand more. That is something I should have done more on my code in order to not get lost and not forget what is what.

I liked working with the sliders and wrapping my head trying to remember what sides makes it whiter or blacker. It's more engaging/complex to let's say get a pinkish skin color with the three sliders instead of instantly choosing it with a color wheel.

Geeze those eyeballs are big! I think it was a grat choice. The character is definetly locked in, working 12 hours shifts with no breaks of course, posing to get his colors changed for our satisfaction.

Suggestions: Maybe it is just me because I open it on a larger monitor, but when I open it I feel like there is a lot of blank space that could be removed by just enlarging everything. I zommed at 150% and I could see things clearly without things being to large. There might be way to adapt to different screen size with %. I don't know...

Also, maybe I don't get it but the clear drawing with the color picker on the left top corner don't seem to work for me. I think it is supposed to reset to color to the color you choose on the color picker. I can see the clear button frame being touched but nothing happens.

Great job! Yeah it's a simple portrait like you say but I like it! I like how you did the half circle as one single type of shape. I also did wierd shapes like you on my project but I did not think it through like you just did. I guess you thougt in a mathematical and logic way that you could get those kind of half-shapes with the half_pi. This makes a lot of sense when I think about it. Me for example I only did a regular circle and hid a shape over it to cheat it.

What's up with that outfit? Do you wear a cool red hat and matching shirt occasionaly? That would be great. I would love to come coding in some kind of suit. We are working on some serious stuff we should look the part. It also makes me think of a magician outfit. Does your powers makes you able to generate clear blue skies everywhere you go?

Beau travail! I think the blue tone is a great addition it sets this moody tone that is uptlifted to this dreamy and contemplative state with the light yellow. Are you an introverted person with la tête dans les nuages? The project makes me feel this, maybe also because I can connect through that since I am just like that.

Your opacity seems to work perfectly. I tried to work with opacity too but I couldn't make it work. The choice of music is perfect, it suits the vibe of the project. It's fun to read your
//comments over every parts. It reads like a diary where we get a glimpse of the process. It seems like you had fun even though you may have had a hard time sometimes.

It's great that your readme file is so detailed. I just have to open your repository and I instantly know what you did. It looks very professional. The instructions and explanations your provide are clear and it's cool that you added comments where you took inspirations from. We should all learn to present our stuff like you do.
